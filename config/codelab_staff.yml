  title: Founder & Programs Director
  bio: I dig helping people learn - and coding things that help people learn. My favorite way of getting to know someone is over a warm cup, so <a href="mailto:chrisvfritz@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> and you can tell me about <em>your</em> passions.
  tech: A lot of stuff - I like to play! I also love meeting other developers, so if there's something specific you'd like help with, I almost certainly know someone who could help if I can't.

  name: Stuart Pearman
  bio: Hi, I'm Stuart! I haven't been coding for long, a little more than two years, but what I've discovered is that you can do a lot with a little knowledge. Coding has become a passion of mine, but learning new things and sharing them with others is really what I love to do most. As someone who has too many hobbies to count, coding has complimented my life ways I never could have expected, and many of the positive opportunities I've had in the past few years would have never come to me had I not developed this wonderful new skill. I hope to continue to learn and to grow, creating new experiences for myself and others for many years to come.
  tech: Design and animation, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery, Git and GitHub, and video game development with JS Canvas or Unity.
