  title: Upgrade the todo list with objects
  criteria:
    - Instead of storing each todo as a string, todos are stored as objects with `title`, `description`, and `isComplete` properties
    - The new todo input is upgraded to a `form` that collects both a title and a longer description
    - Each todo is displayed as a `checkbox`, which will be checked if `isComplete` is `true`
    - Each todo checkbox has a `label`, which contains the `title` of the todo
    - The `description` of each todo is stored in the `title` attribute of the `label`, so that it appears in a tooltip when users hold their mouse over the todo
    - For each todo, `isComplete` begins as `false`
    - Checking or unchecking a checkbox marks its `isComplete` attribute to `true` or `false`, respectively
    - Next to the "Clear All" button, an additional button exists to "Clear Completed"
  steps:
    download: |
      1. `cd` into the directory where you're keeping your Code Lab projects (unless you're already there)
      2. Create a copy of the previous project with `cp -R codelab-js-arrays {{project-folder-name}}`
      3. `cd` into your `{{project-folder-name}}` directory
      4. `git remote rm origin` (so that our `origin` remote doesn't point to our old project on GitHub)
      5. `git remote add origin {{clone-URL}}`
